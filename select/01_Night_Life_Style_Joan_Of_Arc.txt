Uh oh Jesus pain
This self aware transient toothache glows when truth telling
I always correct correct the wrong things
Flap my bare stigmata hand like a puppet talking

Uh oh Jesus pain
To live with the old partners misunderstanding of the plan
Never felt real til made famous and made to behave fake
Blame the daylight hours shame on all those love songs i sang

Uh oh Jesus pain
I get it i don't get it and i always feel the same
The tired task of identity
That spot i poke in others the same spot I'd cut from me
